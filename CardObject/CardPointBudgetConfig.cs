/// SCALING RATIONALE (Updated for 100 HP, ~7 round fights, 100 energy per turn):
/// - Common (35 points): 25-35 energy cost, 50-75 damage/healing potential
/// - Uncommon (55 points): 35-45 energy cost, 75-120 damage/healing potential  
/// - Rare (80 points): 45-55 energy cost, 120-180 damage/healing potential
/// 
/// With these values:
/// - Players can play 2-3 cards per turn (energy costs 25-55 per card)
/// - Fights last ~7 rounds (100 HP รท 15-20 average damage per turn)
/// - Energy restoration becomes meaningful and strategic
/// - Status effects and shields scale appropriately for longer fights
