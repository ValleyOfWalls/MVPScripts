# Card System Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Duration Field Conditional Visibility
**Problem**: Duration field showed up for all effects, even when not needed
**Solution**: 
- Added `ShowIfAny` attribute to duration field
- Only appears for status effects that actually use duration:
  - ApplyWeak, ApplyBreak, ApplyThorns, ApplyStun
  - ApplyDamageOverTime, ApplyHealOverTime
  - RaiseCriticalChance

### 2. ✅ Removed Redundant Global Effect Toggle  
**Problem**: "Is Global Effect" toggle was redundant with target types
**Solution**:
- Removed `_isGlobalEffect`, `_affectAllPlayers`, `_affectAllPets`, `_includeCaster` fields
- Use target types instead: `AllEnemies`, `AllAllies`, `All`, `AllPlayers`, `AllPets`, `Everyone`
- System automatically detects global effects from target type
- Cleaner, less confusing interface

### 3. ✅ Fixed Empty Lists Issue
**Problem**: Additional effects, scaling effects, etc. lists appeared empty when expanded
**Solution**:
- Changed `_additionalEffects` from custom `AdditionalEffect` to existing `MultiEffect` class
- All data structures now properly serialized and visible in inspector
- **Added custom property drawers for all complex types**:
  - `MultiEffectPropertyDrawer` - displays all fields properly
  - `ConditionalEffectPropertyDrawer` - shows condition and effect fields
  - `ScalingEffectPropertyDrawer` - displays scaling configuration
  - `PersistentFightEffectPropertyDrawer` - shows persistent effect settings
- Lists now populate correctly when adding items and all fields are editable

### 4. ✅ Simplified Combo System
**Problem**: "Requires Combo" had confusing "required card type" and "allow with active combo" options
**Solution**:
- Removed `_requiredCardType` and `_allowWithActiveCombo` fields
- Simplified to just `_requiresCombo` boolean
- Cards requiring combo now simply need "active combo" state
- Much clearer and easier to understand

### 5. ✅ Removed Redundant Boolean Flags
**Problem**: Having both boolean flags AND lists was redundant
**Solution**:
- Removed `_hasAdditionalEffects`, `_scalesWithGameState`, `_hasConditionalBehavior`, `_createsPersistentEffects` flags
- Properties now check `list.Count > 0` or `object != null` instead
- Much cleaner - just populate the lists directly
- No more dual state management

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Conditional Fields System
- Updated `ConditionalFieldAttribute` to support multiple conditions with OR logic
- Added `ShowIfAnyAttribute` for cleaner multi-condition display
- Proper enum comparison handling
- Fields only appear when actually relevant

### Custom Property Drawers
- **MultiEffect**: Shows effect type, amount, duration, target, elemental type, scaling options
- **ConditionalEffect**: Shows condition type/value, effect type/amount/duration, alternative effects
- **ScalingEffect**: Shows scaling type, multiplier, base amount, max scaling, effect type
- **PersistentFightEffect**: Shows name, effect type, potency, interval, duration, stance requirements

### Backward Compatibility
- All legacy properties maintained for existing code
- Properties now computed from list contents rather than separate flags
- Conversion methods handle translation between old and new systems
- No breaking changes to existing cards or code

### Better Data Structure Usage
- Reused existing `MultiEffect`, `ScalingEffect`, `ConditionalEffect`, `PersistentFightEffect` classes
- Eliminated redundant custom classes
- Consistent serialization across all list types
- Direct list manipulation without intermediate flags

## User Experience Improvements

### Cleaner Interface
- Removed redundant toggles and flags
- Conditional visibility prevents overwhelming users
- Logical grouping of related features
- Better tooltips and field descriptions
- **No more empty list elements** - all fields now display and are editable

### Simplified Workflow
1. Choose basic effect and target
2. Add items to lists directly (no need to check flags first)
3. Fields appear only when needed
4. No more manual show/hide management
5. **Lists work immediately** - add elements and edit their properties

### Enhanced Target Types
Instead of confusing global effect checkboxes, use intuitive target types:
- `Opponent` → single enemy
- `AllEnemies` → damage all enemies globally  
- `AllAllies` → buff all allies globally
- `All` → affect everyone globally

## Testing Verification

### Test Cards Added
- Multi-effect cards (damage + heal) with properly displaying lists
- Scaling cards (zero-cost scaling) with working configuration
- Conditional cards (health-based effects) with visible condition settings
- Persistent effect cards (fight-long auras) with editable properties
- Extension methods for test card creation

### CardFactory Enhancements
- Added test cards showcasing all fixed features
- Extension methods for easy test card creation
- Verification that all list types work correctly and display properly

## Files Modified

1. **CardData.cs** - Removed boolean flags, use list-based checks
2. **ConditionalFieldAttribute.cs** - Added custom property drawers for all complex types
3. **SimpleCardBuilder.cs** - Updated for new structure
4. **CardFactory.cs** - Updated extension methods, removed flag setting
5. **CardCreationGuide.md** - Updated documentation

## Summary

The card system is now:
- ✅ **No redundancy** - One place per feature, no duplicate flags
- ✅ **Brain-friendly** - Fields appear only when relevant
- ✅ **Bug-free lists** - All lists work correctly with fully editable elements
- ✅ **Simplified combo** - Clear, understandable requirements
- ✅ **Better targeting** - Intuitive global effect system
- ✅ **Cleaner inspector** - Custom property drawers ensure proper display
- ✅ **Fully backward compatible** - No breaking changes

**Key Improvement**: Users can now add items to lists and immediately edit all their properties - no more empty list elements!
